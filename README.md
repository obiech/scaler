## Technology Stack

This application is built using the following technologies:
- **Flutter**: The primary framework for developing the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Dio**: A powerful HTTP client for Dart that provides robust support for RESTful APIs.
- **Bloc**: A state management library that helps separate business logic from UI components.
- **Hydrated Bloc**: Extends the Bloc library to support state persistence.
- **Equatable**: A Dart package used for value equality, simplifying comparisons between objects.
- **GetIt**: A service locator for dependency injection, allowing easy management of dependencies.

## Architecture

The application follows the **Clean Architecture** principle, which promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and test. It is structured into three main layers:

### Presentation Layer
- This layer handles the UI components and manages the state of the application through Bloc.
- **Widgets**: Each UI component is encapsulated in its own widget, promoting reusability and modularity.
- **Part**: Private widgets are utilized to enhance code organization and maintainability. By encapsulating UI components into private widgets, we achieve several benefits aligned with Clean Architecture principles:.
- **Error Handling**: The UI gracefully handles different error states, providing feedback to the user in case of API failures or empty data.

### Domain Layer
- Contains the business logic of the application, including entities and use cases.
- **Entities**: Represent the core data models of the application, which are independent of any framework.
- **Use Cases**: Define the actions that can be performed with the entities, keeping the application’s business logic clean and testable.

### Data Layer
- Responsible for data management, including fetching data from APIs and local storage.
- **Repositories**: Abstract data sources and provide a clean API to the domain layer, ensuring that the domain layer remains agnostic to data retrieval methods.
- **Dio Client**: Utilizes Dio to handle API requests, managing responses and errors effectively.
- **Error Handling**: Try catch blocks are used here to ensure to exception escapes the data layer.

## State Management

### Bloc and Hydrated Bloc
- **Bloc**: Implements the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage application state.
- **Hydrated Bloc**: Automatically persists the state of the Blocs, enabling users to resume their activities seamlessly after app restarts.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies state management by allowing for reactive programming.
  - Promotes a clean separation between the UI and business logic, improving code maintainability and testability.

## Dependency Injection

### GetIt
- **GetIt** is utilized for dependency injection throughout the application.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies the management of dependencies, allowing classes to retrieve what they need without explicit constructors.
  - Supports lazy loading, optimizing resource use by instantiating objects only when necessary.
  - Promotes decoupled architecture, making unit testing easier by allowing mocks to be injected.

## Routing

- **Navigator**: Flutter’s built-in Navigator widget is used for routing between different screens.
- **Named Routes**: Using named routes enhances readability and maintainability, providing a centralized way to manage navigation.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies navigation and makes the app's structure clearer to other developers.
  - Facilitates easier handling of navigation events, such as back navigation.

## Testing Strategy

### Widget Testing
- Comprehensive widget tests are implemented to validate the functionality of UI components.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures that UI behaves as expected under various conditions, improving reliability.
  - Allows for quick feedback on UI changes during development.

### Unit Testing
- Unit tests are implemented for business logic in the domain layer, ensuring that use cases and entities function as intended.

## Setup Instructions
